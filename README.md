# Kendrick Mass Defect Analysis for High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description
-----------
This code performs a Kendrick Mass Defect (KMD) analysis of user input mass spectral data by creating a feature list via the XCMS peak picking algorithm.
The workflow includes generating a suspect list, generating a feature list, and subsequently creating a KMD plot. 

Suspect List Generation:
- Utilizes the creat_KMD_susp_list.v1 and func_calc_residual R codes.
- Combines suspect lists from a users working directory
- Calculates the kendrick mass and kendrick mass defect for each list member for a given neutral loss (ex: CF2, C2F4)

KMD Analysis then occurs in 3 steps (3 individual scripts):  
- 1-PatRoon_XCMS_feature_opti: Optimizes the parameters used for XCMS peak picking and featurelist generation
- 2-PatRoon_featuregroup: Performs peak picking using XCMS and generates a featurelist from the data (to fascilitate KMD analysis in step 3)  
- 3-KMD_analysis: Screens featurelist for overlap with the suspect list based on exact mass, scans for homologous series of the same mass defect value (KMD analysis)
> [!CAUTION]  
> **DO NOT CONSIDER the creat_KMD_susp_list match as a comprehensive suspect screening method. Results need to be verified**


Dependency and installation
----------------
R(>=4.3.1)    

RTools 

patRoon(>=2.3.0) Check [patron handbook](https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon/handbook_bd/index.html)
**Optional**: Text editor such as Rstudio or Visual Studio Code 

MetaboCoreUtils. To install this package, start R and enter:  

``` r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("MetaboCoreUtils")
```

Getting started
----------------
Suspect List Generation
1. Download the creat_KMD_susp_list.v1 and func_calc_residual R codes, store in a folder on your local machine.
2. In the folder, put all suspect lists that are to be combined (**See example_suspect_list.csv**)
3. Open the creat_KMD_susp_list.v1 code, select the repeating unit to screen for (ex: CF2, C2F4), and run the code to combine the suspect lists.
4. Output will be in the format "KMD_C2F4_neg_SuspectList_2024-07-19" where 'C2F4' is the repeating unit, 'neg' (or 'pos') reflects the polarity of the suspect list members, and 2024-07-19 is the date the list was generated.

KMD Analysis:
1. Download all codes to your local machine, create a directory (folder), and put all codes in the directory
2. Create two folders in your directory called "input" and "ouptut"
3. In the input folder, put: (1) a sample list (default name is sample_list_KMD), (2) your suspect list generated previously, (3) all datafiles converted from .raw/.wiff2./etc file format to .mzXML (can convert using MSConvert or another software)
4. Run the scripts in order, taking care to update the parameters in script 2 (2-PatRoon_featuregroup) with the optimized peak picking parameters identified in script 1 (1-PatRoon_XCMS_feature_opti), and to have the featurelist generated from script 2 in the output folder before running script 3 (3-KMD_analysis)
